# skeletout

Skeletout (written in Go)

This project was created quickly bootstrap a project.
Right now, it only supports the creation of <a href="/mitsuhiko/flask">Flask</a> (Python micro-framework) projects.
I started working on skeleout because I wanted to learn the Go programming language.

To use it (assuming you have Go installed), run these commands:

1) go get github.com/opreaalex/skeletout
2) cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/opreaalex/skeletout
3) go build
4) ./skeletout -a test-application -o $HOME/test-application
